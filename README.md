Web Accessibility Tips

We’re not here to waste your time. Here’s the deal:

Color Contrast: Don’t make your site unreadable. Ensure a decent contrast ratio.

Keyboard Navigation: If your site doesn’t work with just a keyboard, it’s broken.

Alt Text: Screen readers need alt text. Don’t skip it.

Semantic HTML: It’s not just for SEO—it makes your site work better for everyone.

Tools We Recommend

If you care about accessibility, use the right tools:

WAVE: Quick checks for accessibility issues.

Lighthouse: Google’s tool to audit performance, accessibility, and more.

axe: Automated testing for accessibility issues in your browser.
